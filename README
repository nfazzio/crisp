This repo contains all work pertinent to my research for Constanza.

Dependencies not within the python standard library: bs4, lxml.

Currently the output and logging is just printed to stdout.
I still need to write the code to output the data in a csv.

TODO:
Output to csv.
Analyze csv for scraping coverage.
Work out edge cases.
Write committee parser for when a bill is examined by multiple committees.
More date parsing.
Finish Option Parser
