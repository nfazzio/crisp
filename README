This repo contains all work pertinent to my research for Constanza.

Dependencies not within the python standard library: bs4, lxml.
I would recommend using pip to install these. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip

to use script: cd into .../crisp/scrape
python scrape.py

TODO:
Fix case when multiple senators introduce bill.
Analyze csv for scraping coverage.
Work out edge cases.
